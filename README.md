# Third party packages

the following packages are used for better use of git, following the best practices of the conventional commits and semantic version:
- commitlint: verify if the commit message follow the conventional commits pattern
- husky: help to create a git hook to execute actions with determinated commands (here we use a hook to execute the commitlint when we execute a new git commit)
- commitzen: generate a interface in the terminal to access all the types of commits and their description
